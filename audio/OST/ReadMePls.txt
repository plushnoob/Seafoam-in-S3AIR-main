This is the OST of Extra Slot Seafoam. This is a list of all 9 unique tracks (and one re-used from online) in the mod, listed in order.

(I told Lunar to do what feels right. If you're reading this, Lunar, or any composer who attends, I'll be sure to send you mock-ups of the tracks.)

01 - "The Island of the Clouds..." for the Intro
This track is for the intro cutscene, rather than AIZ1 playing.

02 - "Blackout" for Carnival Night Act 1
Seafoam finds their way into Carnival Night! ...Looks like the power went out when the Death Egg went offline... Better find that auxilary!

03 - "An Underlying Problem..." for Fallen Battery Act 1
The first of 5 new acts. Seafoam seems to have found the sunken wreckage of the Flying Battery deep within the sands of Sandopolis.

04 - "Technical Tombs" for Fallen Battery Act 2
I ain't afraid of no ghost- hey who turned out the- OH MY GOD IT SCOOBY

05 - "Mecha's Reverie" for Sky Sanctuary Act "S"
